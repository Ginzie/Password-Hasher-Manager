    <div>How this works: <br>
        <br>You type a password, and a key. The password will change depending on the key
        <br>(You can have the same password for everything, but if the key is different
        <br>then the password is different). This program is entirely offline and
        <br>does not store passwords or keys locally or externally so either remember them
        <br>or write them down.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <input type="text" id="pass" placeholder="Password">
        <input type="text" id="key" placeholder="Key">
        <button type="button" id="submit">Generate</button>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>Hashed Password:</div>
    <div id="password">(Password will show here)</div>
    <br>
    <div>
        For the sake of transparency, the steps of the algorithm are as follows:
        <br>
        <br>Step 1: Add up the key
        <ul>
            <li>Look at every letter in the key.</li>
            <li>For each letter, find its number value (like A=65, B=66).</li>
            <li>Add all those numbers together to get a starting total.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>Step 2: Mix the password with the key total
        <ul>
            <li>Look at each letter in the password.</li>
            <li>For each letter, turn it into its number value and multiply it by the current key total.</li>
            <li>After each letter, lower the key total a little (subtract twice the length of the key).</li>
            <li>Write down all these numbers one after another to make one big long string of digits.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>Step 3: Break the long number string into pieces
        <ul>
            <li>Start with a “helper number” that’s the length of the password plus the length of the key.</li>
            <li>Go through the long string of digits:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the helper number is even, take the next two digits.</li>
                    <li>If it’s odd, take the next one digit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After each chunk, update the helper number by multiplying it by 1.5 and rounding down.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>Step 4: Turn numbers into safe letters and symbols
        <ul>
            <li>Take each chunk and add 32 to make it a normal printable character.</li>
            <li>If that character is “unsafe” (like <,>, &, or anything weird), fix it:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Square the number and then shrink it down into the printable range.</li>
                        <li>If it’s still unsafe, just increase the number by 1.</li>
                        <li>Wrap around if it goes too high.</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Convert the number to a real letter or symbol.</li>
        </ul>
        <br> Step 5: Combine all the characters
        <ul>
            <li>Stick all the safe letters and symbols together.</li>
            <li>That’s your final hashed password.</li>
        </ul>
